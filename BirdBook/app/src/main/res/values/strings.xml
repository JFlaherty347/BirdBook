    <string name="paragraph1">Identifying birds is difficult to do and its fine if we are not able to do it immediately. The challenge comes from seeing and interpreting details of the birds we see, often at a distance. A patient and deliberate approach to identification well yield more successful results. It is important to have an idea of what to focus on and to ask yourself questions while observing. As a general rule, focus on the face and the beak. The general shape of the beak will help you place the bird into a category of related species while the markings will help reveal the specific bird. At farther distances the markings become more difficult to see so focus on the way it flies and watch it forage. The most important part above all else is to practice and gain experience. With enough practice you can get a mental image of what the birds should look like, and what habitats it likes to hang out in. Learn from your mistakes too, when you misidentify a bird ask yourself, what was confusing, or what sort of information that I picked up mislead me? It can also help to take pictures so you can take as much time as you need in the future.</string>
